# UWaste

**Overview:**

UWaste is an innovative platform that uses Machine Learning to revolutionize waste sorting, aiming to improve waste sorting practices among students at university and reach our goal of a 90% waste diversion rate by 2035. With a simple scan of the waste in front of the camera, UWaste efficiently categorizes it, making waste management a breeze. But that's not all! When not in scanning mode, UWaste provides valuable educational content, including the University's Shift: The Zero Sorting Game and Waste Classification Support website, fostering a culture of environmental consciousness and responsibility.
